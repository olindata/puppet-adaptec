This is the puppet-tribily-adaptec module.

Update: Jan 18, 2012
Module has gone through big changes - Must update for all Users

1. Need to manually include "Include=/etc/zabbix/conf.d" to your /etc/zabbix/zabbix_agentd.conf
2. Manually remove your cronjob for this script if you were using earlier version - runs via UserParameters now, more stable this way.
